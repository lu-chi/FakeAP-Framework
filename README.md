FakeAP-Framework
================

Fake Access Point Framework is a tool based on framework concepts well known from BackTrack and Kali distros - Metasploit and SEToolkit.
Basic functions will be:
- creating a monitor interfaces
- creating bridged AP 
- cooperation with SEToolkit in webpage cloning
- DHCPd/DNSmasq
- wireshark/tcpdump/ngrep/etc. packet file creation
- co-op with Aircrack-ng, Reaver, SSLstrip, URLsnarf & all what will jump into my mind

Framework will be based on bash and python/ ruby. Some conecpts will be added after initial commit - that would be msf  and kaermatasploit data exchange.

More things to come soon...
